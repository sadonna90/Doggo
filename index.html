            <h2>Chachi</h2>
            <p>Meet sweet Chachi! This sweet, 1 year old boy was found as a stray and taken to one of the highest-kill shelters in CA, where we scooped him up. This 13 lb kid is very shy, but once he continues to learn that humans can be pretty awesome he will continue to come out of his shell! He’s doing well in his foster home and although he’s cautious, once he’s in your arms he totally melts and we can’t wait to watch him continue to build his confidence.</p>

            <h2>Zuzu</h2>
            <p>Meet sweet Zuzu! This darling had a rough start to life. She was displaced on the streets after her family’s home in Mexico burned to the ground. Luckily, a Good Samaritan took her in and she finally made her way to us and is ready for her forever home!<br>
            She gets along with other dogs and is just a sweet, energetic, goofy pup. SHe can be a little shy but quickly warms. We estimate her to be about 4-5 months old, and she's approximately 9 lbs.</p>
